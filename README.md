# cc-chooser

The Creative Commons License Chooser is meant to help people learn about CC licenses, and select the license that best fits their needs. The new version in this repo places greater importance on usability and an educational experience of the six CC licenses.

## About
Repository containing the source code for the new Creative Commons License Chooser. The new chooser is still in beta, and a beta deployment can be found [here](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/).

This site is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Buefy](https://buefy.org/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

#### Roadmap
There is still some work to go before the new chooser is ready to replace the existing chooser. These tasks include:
 - Improvments to the Chooser's UI
 - Internationalization
 - Legal reviews of the site's content
 - Infrastructural work (Setting up analytics, monitoring, error logging)

Tasks, issues, and discussion related to the release of the new chooser are tracked with the [`Launch Milestone`](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-chooser/milestone/1).

## Getting Started
Run the following commands in order to have the code up and running on your machine:

``` bash
# installs dependencies
$ npm install

# Builds and serves assets with hot-reload
$ npm run dev
```
You should now have the application running and accessible at http://localhost:8080 (note: will run on a different port if 8080 is occupied, most common alternative port is 8081).
